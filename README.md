## Hiya, I'm Brew and I'm an Arctic Fox dude trying to build a future based on high quality software software ❄️

### What do I like to code?

- Projects based on games I play
- Some software solutions nobody asked for
- A 500 lines piece of software trying reinvent the wheel 🛞
- Proofs of concepts that never work

### Achievements

- I have many but if I told you I will be in big trouble 😵‍💫

### About me

- I use arch btw
- I wrote this about me in my boring English class
- I did an English test and I got a supposed C2 score (I don't think that's real)
- I'm from Colombia (not Columbia)
- I'm a furry
- Meow >:3
