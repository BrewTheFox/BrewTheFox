## ❄️ My name is Brew and I'm an Arctic Fox dude trying to build a future based on high quality software ❄️

### 🕜 Things I do in my free time 🕜:

- Teach myself how to code stuff.
- Pushing technology's boundaries to make amazing software for personal use.
- Reverse engineering code that makes me curious on the processes behind it (Mostly WEB but I can do ASM/IL).
- Backend development (sorry y'all I rather logic over aesthetics).

### 📝 Achievements 📝:

- Reporting +2 critical errors to an app with 1M+ registered users.
- Painfully writing by hand a FurASM challenge for my Roblox profile.
- Keeping my OPSEC behind four layers (you're halfway through or mid-high trust identity).
- Many other things I did when I was younger.

### 🦊 About me 🦊:

- Proud Linux user (both for servers and daily use).
- I try to learn new things every day.
- I can barely speak English, even though I scored C2 on an online test.
- My friends think that I'm paranoid but they won't take me seriously when I talk about the dangers of the internet.
- I love fluffy people from the internet and I'm one of them too >:3.
- I don't enjoy vibe coding as much as I enjoy doing it manually, It makes me feel extremely happy to know that I can control everything that my computer does!
- I'm currently interested in HUMINT!
- I will have to create a unilateral link to this profile from my portfolio, the architecture I have in mind uses HMAC and. complex backend that will display a code below.
